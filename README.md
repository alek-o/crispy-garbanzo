### Simple c++ object-programming project
---
It consists of several TSP solving algorithms with a little twist:

In graph $G$, a Hamiltonian cycle that minimizes the weight of the heaviest edge must be found. Additionally, there might be mandatory edges specified that the final answer must include.

The program compares the average execution times of all specified algorithms.
